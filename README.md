##### Personal Website

Uses sass, html and JS

  I'm a Web Developer and an Interface designer. I design and craft beautiful UI
  for the web. Atleast that's what I tell people (that's you mate). I mostly create
  web apps (for myself,lol) and design a shit-ton of UI components (also for myself).

   I'm very fascinated by how things are built and how they influence our minds. That's
   why I'm on a life long adventure of learning new things.

  At present, I work at a small media company as an "I don't have a title". I wear a few hats there.
